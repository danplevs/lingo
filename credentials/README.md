In my local setup, the key file (JSON, named **google-translate.json**) generated by the service account in Google Cloud Platform is placed in this folder.  

You can put it in a different location, but you'll have to change `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` in [.env](../.env).

For more info about the setup, check the [API setup documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup?hl=pt_BR).
