# lingo
This repository contains the notebook that I've created to help me learn some german, with functions like translation, NLP and text to speech.  
I've just started to refactor this little project (see refactor branch), aiming to apply new python and software design skills I have been learning and maybe extend the project in the future, with more supported languages and functionalities.
